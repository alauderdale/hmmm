					The Problem
				%p
					Sometimes when working on a project, we have a project manager leaving feedback & to-do items. We also have other users making comments as they see fit. Sifting through the comments from the “important” users can be difficult. 
				%h3
					The Solution
				%p
					Expanding the comments section like you have done 
					%a{:href=>"http://www.invisionapp.com/new-features/17/the-redesigned-comments-tab"}
						here 
					is excellent. Such a natural progression to move them toward tasks. This is how we have always used them. Simply add the ability to sort comments by user, following the same pattern you have set up with the screen and date sorting!
